# File Searcher Usage Guide

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x should be installed on your system.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the script files.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

## Usage
To run the file searcher, use the following command:


Replace `<directory>` with the directory path to search within. Use `OS` to search the entire operating system. Specify `<name>` as the file name to search for, and `<extension>` as the file extension to filter by.

Example usage:


This command will search for files with the name "myfile" and the extension ".txt" within the entire operating system.

## Additional Options
- To exit the program, type `EXIT` at the prompt.

## Output
The script will display the search prompt `>>> (fileSearcher/OS) $` where you can input subdirectories to search within the specified directory. The script will then display the matching file or files found.
